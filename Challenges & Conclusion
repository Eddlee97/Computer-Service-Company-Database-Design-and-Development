Challenges:

One of the biggest challenges was to create data for our database.  
We avoided importing pre-existing data online and created our own data values. 
This was an issue for us as we had no previous knowledge of computer repairs shop rates. 
However, we had a pleasant while creating our unique data. 
For example for some values we used Windows 9 as an operating system for some jobs.
Another significant challenge was the implementation part.  
It would have been easier if we were able to add all of the values into the entities at once.  
However, we were getting numerous different errors when we were trying to run multiple lines of many of our SQL codes during the implementation process. 
The problem was, we often couldnâ€™t figure out which specific line is causing errors.  So, we were forced to write and run one line of SQL at a time. 


Conclusion:

Creating a digital database for any company is effective, even for small businesses. 
By having this database, our model business can benefit in various ways: 
it can easily track record of its customers, employees, appointments and type of repair services the company needs to offer.

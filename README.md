# Computer Services Company Database Design and Development

## Project Overview & Business Model:
Computer Services Company is a generic computer repair shop that diagnose and offer repair/replacement services to customers. Customers may walk in or make appointments to have their computers checked up. We will need a business account to buy required parts and materials in bulk. Activities are done in a manual way in the company. The manual system is very inefficient, time consuming and heavy paper works day to day. There is no methods to maintain customers, appointments, employees, repair services and service items information in systematic way. It is difficult to know available items, its quantities and description of each services while keeping track of everything that needs to get the service done. Due to all existing problems, it is important for us to keep track of operating system, CPU, GPU and memory of all of the computers. We will also record description, duration and price for each of the repair service performed. Additionally, We may need to track the technicians that work on the computers. Therefore, developing a proper and effective database mangement system is needed for this organization. It will minimize time consume and cost day to day activities furthermore increasing the efficiency. It would simplify all interactions and provide simple environments to do employee's works easily.

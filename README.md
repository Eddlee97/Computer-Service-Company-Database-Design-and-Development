# Database-Management-System-project
Database Development with SQL for Computer Repair Services Company

Project Overview: The goal of this project was to design a database model that can satisfy our initial goals stated in the proposal. I wanted to develop a model Computer Repair management system for a generic computer repair shop. 
 
Project business model: Tech Service Company is a computer repair shop that diagnose and offer repair/replacement services to customers. Customers may walk in or make appointments to have their computers checked up. I will need a business account to buy required parts and materials in bulk. It is important for us to keep track of operating system, CPU, GPU and memory of all of the computers. I will also record description, duration and price for each of the repair service performed. Additionally, I may need to track the technicians that work on the computers.

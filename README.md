# Computer Services Company Database Design and Development

## Project Overview:
The goal of this project was to design a database model that can satisfy our initial goals stated in the proposal. We wanted to develop a model Computer Repair management system for a generic computer repair shop. 
 
## Project business model:
Tech Service Company is a computer repair shop that diagnose and offer repair/replacement services to customers. Customers may walk in or make appointments to have their computers checked up. We will need a business account to buy required parts and materials in bulk. It is important for us to keep track of operating system, CPU, GPU and memory of all of the computers. We will also record description, duration and price for each of the repair service performed. Additionally, We may need to track the technicians that work on the computers.

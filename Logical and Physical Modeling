Relations:

Customer(CustomerID(k), FirstName, LastName, Phone_Number, Street, City, State, ZipCode)

Computer (ComputerID(k), Manufacturer, Model, Year, Operating_System, Serial_Number, CustomerID(fk))

Appointment (AppointmentID(k), Appointment_Date, Appointment_Time, ComputerID(fk)

ServiceItem_Provided ( AppointmentID(fk)(k), LineItem_Number(k), Part_Number, Quantity, Extended_Price, Labor_Hours, EmployeeId(fk), ServiceId(fk))

Employee (EmployeeID(k), FirstName, LastName, Pay_Rate)

RepairService (ServiceID (k), Service_Description, Service_Duration, Service_Price)

Normalization:

Customer (CustomerID(k), FirstName, LastName, Phone_Number, Street, City, State, ZipCode)
key: CustomerID
FD1: CusomterID -> FirstName, LastName, Phone_Number, Street, City, State, ZipCode
FD2: ZipCode -> City, State

In order to normalize the relation, we will split the relation “Customer” to deal with transitive dependencies.  
The new relations will be “Customer_Info” and “Address”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Customer_Info (CustomerID(k), FirstName, LastName, Phone_Number, Street, ZipCode)
key: CustomerID
FD1: CustomerID -> FirstName, LastName, Phone_Number, Street, ZipCode

Address (City, State, ZipCode (k)
Key: ZipCode
FD1: ZipCode -> City, State

Computer (ComputerID(k), Manufacturer, Model, Year, Operating_System, Serial_Number, CustomerID(fk))
key: ComputerID, CustomerID
FD1: ComputerID, CustomerID -> Manufacturer, Model, Year, Operating_System, Serial_Number

Appointment (AppointmentID(k), Appointment_Date, Appointment_Time, ComputerID(fk)
key: AppointmentID, ComputerID
FD1: AppointmentID, ComputerID -> Appointment_Date, Appointment_Time

ServiceItem_Provided ( AppointmentID(fk)(k), LineItem_Number(k), Part_Number, Quantity, Extended_Price, Labor_Hours, EmployeeId(fk), ServiceId(fk))
Key:  AppointmentID, LineItem_Number
FD1:  AppointmentID, LineItem_Number ->  Part_Number, Quantity, Extended_Price, Labor_Hours, EmployeeID, ServiceID

Employee (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Pay_Rate)
key: EmployeeID
FD1: EmployeeID -> FirstName, LastName, Pay_Rate

RepairService (ServiceID, Service_Description, Service_Duration, Service_Price)
key: ServiceID
FD1: ServiceID -> Service_Description, Service_Duration, Service_Price

//We de-normalized customer_info and address back into the original Customer relation to make keep the implementation process relatively simpler.
